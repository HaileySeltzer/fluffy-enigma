        <h2>The Birth</h2>
        <p>Stars are so interesting, particuarly at birth because they are made of older stars that exploded in a supernova. They are essentially recreations of older stars, and it is very cool to think of how a star can live on in another. The current main explanation for how stars form is this: they form from a nebulae (a cloud of gas). This mainly consists of hydrogen and helium, with the remnants of the older stars. The gas molecules are pulled closer as the nebula collapses due to gravity, increasing the temperature, which makes the nebula separate into smaller clouds. Once it becomes hot enough, it becomes a protostar with a remaining dust envelope from the smaller cloud. As the envelope blows away, the new star is formed.</p>

        <h5>This video was very detailed in only a short period of time and had amazing animations of what a star's birth looks like, as well as planets. For anyone looking to just gain a small insight in a few minutes about the birth of stars, I would highly recommend this video.</h5>
        <h2>The Life</h2>
        <p>After the star has formed, its size determines the life it will have. As a star expands over its lifetime, the core runs out of hydrogen and helium and becomes dimmer. Also, the larger the star's mass, the shorter the life span. If the star remains very small, it becomes a brown dwarf, unable to sustain hydrogen fusion reactions. If it maintains enough mass, it will be in the main sequence phase. Most stars turn out to be main sequence phases. After this phase, the star will become a red giant (smaller stars) or red supergiants (larger stars) and stop converting hydrogen to helium. It becomes cooler and turns red, as indicated by the name red giant. From here, size is used again in determining the next phase. Smaller stars can become white dwarfs, which are very small and dense. If a star is very large after being a red giant/supergiant, it can supernova, which is a big explosion. This allows the cycle to restart. Not every star goes through this exact cycle and may even go through phases in between. The diagram below will show the life cycle of a star in a clear and concise way.</p>

        <h2>The Death</h2>
        <p>Dying means different things depending on the size of the star and it does not necessarily mean death with the same finality we tend to associate with it. For instance, small stars don't really die, they can just become inert, traveling aimlessly throughout the universe. They eventually can become black dwarfs, although due to the relatively young age of our universe, there are no known black dwarfs. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, white dwarfs can emerge from the red giants, and will eventually become black dwarfs, signifying the end of its star's life. Another form of dying for these medium-small stars is emitting a planetary nebula, as shown in the diagram. This gives way to form new stars, restarting the cycle. The supernova is also considered death for many stars as it effectively ends its life, although it gives way to new forms. The remaining star core after the supernova can either be a black hole or a neutron star. Neutron stars are extremely dense, have strong gravity, and have high velocities. These neutron stars can cool and spin down as they age. Black holes are extremely dense and have a strong gravity. Overall, the end of a star can come in three main ways: it can become enert, become a black or white dwarf, or supernova. Either way, a star never truly dies as either it lives on, floating in the universe, or its remnants do.</p>
